Download the latest version of the emulator from https://smash64.online:



Follow the instructions generated by the program if the ROM generator fails.

If it still fails after following instructions, utilize the Delta UI. Follow the instructions below:

Step 1: Make sure you have a legal unaltered Super Smash 64 ROM that is a .z64 file 
(.n64 or .v64 will not work!). You can easily convert one of these files to .z64 via Tool64 (download here: https://www.zophar.net/utilities/n64aud/tool-n64.html). 
After conversion, ensure that the conversion was succesful by opening the new file in Tool64.).

Step 2: Start the Delta UI Program. In the Source File box click "Open", then select your ROM file (make sure it is .z64)

Step 3: In the Patch box click "Open", select the current version of smashremix1.1.0.xdelta (in patches folder)

Step 4: In the Output File Box click "Open", select a name for the file that ends in .z64

Step 5: Click patch. You should now have a functioning copy of Smash Remix

ANDROID USERS:

You will have to delta patch as well. There are delta patches available for android.

iOS USERS:

You can utilize the web based patching tool at this website:

MUPEN64PLUS USERS:

If you want the ROM to properly appear in your Mupen64Plus frontend (i.e. m64py)Good ROM known database, copy this text entry and paste it into your 
current mupen64plus.ini:

[D8AB932AFD1CED974ACD33FA984B309ED]
GoodName=SmashRemix1.1.0
CRC=FB816989-6F442541
Status=3
SaveType=SRAM
Players=4
Rumble=Yes
CountPerOp=1

In m64py for Windows, this file is usually inside the folder "C:\Program Files (x86)\M64Py"
If you use other frontend, you can try searching the mupen64plus.ini file in the same folder where it is the frontend executable.
In Linux, this file is usually inside the user folder "/home/your-username/.config/mupen64plus", though this may change with the distribution.
This step is not needed as mupen64plus already runs Smash Remix properly, only that it will add the ROM to the Good ROM compatible database, 
so you do not have to manually search for it each time.

The "CountPerOp" line is the Mupen64Plus equivalent to Project64's "Counter Factor" option.

Also, don't add the "ViRefresh=2200" line to mupen64plus.ini, because mupen64plus uses a different method that automatically calculates the VI refresh 
rate for the game its running to guarantee stable framerate while keeping optimal performance, so no overclocking is needed.
